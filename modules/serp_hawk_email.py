EMAIL STRUCTURE (English version — follow this exactly):
1. Hook (1-2 sentences) — Open with a specific, researched observation about {company_name}'s online presence, industry trend, or growth opportunity. Make them feel seen, not targeted.
2. Problem/Opportunity (2-3 sentences) — Identify a concrete challenge or untapped opportunity they likely face in {industry}. Be specific, not vague.

STYLE RULES:
- Keep total length 120-180 words. Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max each).
- Separate paragraphs with blank lines for readability.
- Conversational and confident — like a knowledgeable friend, not a pushy salesperson.
- Every sentence must earn its place. No filler, no fluff, no generic platitudes.
- Services must be the STAR of the email — the reader should finish knowing exactly what you can do for them.
